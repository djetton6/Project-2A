    <div id="box1">
      <p>Good day class! My name is Desmend Jetton and was born and raised in
        family friendly Las Vegas, NV.
      </p>
      <p>I moved to the Windy City via Los Angeles however,
        and I lived in Los Angeles for 7 years.
      </p>
      <p>Although I miss my West Coast Family, Chicago's opportunity, friendly
        people, awesome public transportation, and beautiful architecture make
        it my favorite city, especially the Brideport area I call home.
      </p>
      <p>I'm planning on visiting Hong Kong next year,
        so Chicago may become #2.
    </p>
